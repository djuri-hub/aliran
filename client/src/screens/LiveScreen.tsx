// Live TV — ONE fullscreen video surface with overlay panels (the reorganization at
// the heart of the redesign; replaces the old Home→Player navigation for live).
//
//   base   : fullscreen <AliranVideo> — playback NEVER stops while browsing. Over it a
//            persistent bottom menu (NowPlayingBar) carries the channel identity + touch
//            controls (Search / Info / Favorite) whenever a channel is open and the
//            left menu is gone. A top-right ChannelChangeIndicator shows tuning progress
//            (spinner + 0→100%) while a zap/select replicates the new feed.
//   overlay1: CategoryRail + ChannelListPanel — the "left menu" browse & zap surface;
//            selecting a row switches the stream AND collapses to fullscreen. It has no
//            manual close control — it auto-hides after inactivity (any touch/focus
//            inside bumps the timer), and BACK collapses it to fullscreen.
//   overlay2: ChannelInfoPanel — channel detail (Info button / long-press a row); honest
//            "No program information" placeholder where an EPG lands later (D2)
//
// Navigation: fullscreen TAP/OK opens the left menu; BACK from the left menu collapses
// back to fullscreen; BACK from fullscreen exits to Menu; BACK from channel detail
// returns to the list. Re-entering Live RESUMES the last channel watched this session
// (lastStreamId) instead of snapping back to the hero.
// TV: the whole D-pad answers while fullscreen, and every direction rides the FOCUS
// ENGINE — invisible focus strips around a central select-catcher band, because
// react-native-tvos on Android does not dispatch HWEvents to useTVEventHandler while a
// view holds focus, so key handling must be focus-based (the S7 lesson). The bottom
// menu's touch buttons are phone-only so they stay out of that focus path.
//
//   UP / DOWN   zap prev/next WITHIN the category the viewer tuned from (an 'All'
//               tune keeps the whole curated channel-number order), like a set-top
//               box's CH+/CH-. See zap() — the scope is lastTuneScope.
//   OK / LEFT   open the channel list, scoped to that same tuned-from category with
//               the playing row focused (openListInContext). Left is where every
//               set-top box in the world puts its channel menu.
//   RIGHT       channel detail for what is playing — the mirror of LEFT: left browses
//               everything else, right describes this. BACK from detail entered THIS
//               way returns to the picture, not to a channel list nobody opened.
//   BACK        leave for the menu.
//
// AND THE BAR NAMES ALL OF IT. None of the above is discoverable on its own — a focus
// strip is invisible by construction — so the NowPlayingBar carries a legend of key
// caps on TV. That is not decoration: a viewer on a TCL set pressed left and right,
// got silence, and reported channel changing as broken when it had worked all along.
// VOD (S8a): library titles play on this same surface — the bottom bar grows a
// seek/pause transport (phone), the SDK's live self-heal disarms itself (port
// recordType), and CH+/CH- stays a live-only ring: zapping from a title lands on
// channel 001 and re-arms every live behavior.
// Guide overlay (WS7, phone only): the full time-grid guide is a MODE of this screen
// rather than a separate screen, so the single video surface keeps playing while the
// viewer browses the schedule. Portrait renders the video as a 16:9 strip on top
// with the grid below (the YouTube-TV/Pluto phone pattern — the AliranVideo element
// only changes STYLE, never tree position, so it never remounts); landscape lays the
// grid over the fullscreen video like the channel list panel. Entered via the Menu
// tile (route param `guide`) or OK/tap on the already-playing row of the channel
// list. TV keeps the dedicated Guide route.
// Orientation defaults (S22 round 3, phone): PORTRAIT's default browse surface is
// the guide — rotating to portrait raises it (collapsing list/info into it), tapping
// portrait fullscreen opens it, and portrait BACK order is fullscreen → guide →
// Menu (the guide strip's tap expands to fullscreen). LANDSCAPE's default stays
// clean fullscreen — tap opens the left menu, BACK collapses guide/list to
// fullscreen then pops, and rotating to landscape collapses the guide. A playback
// error suppresses every auto-guide rule so the error + retry flow stays visible.
// Fullscreen is ALWAYS landscape (S22 round 4, phone): the portrait guide's strip
// tap locks the Activity to landscape via a tiny native module (src/orientation.ts →
// android OrientationModule) and drops to fullscreen; BACK from that fullscreen
// releases the lock, the phone falls back to its physical orientation, and the
// rotation rule above raises the guide if that's portrait. Portrait mounts with a
// channel therefore start in 'guide' (portrait + overlay 'none' exists only
// transiently); errors still show fullscreen-with-error in any orientation.
// Locked-fullscreen tap zones (S22 round 5, phone): while the landscape lock is
// ours, a tap on the LEFT THIRD of the fullscreen catcher returns to the guide
// (release the lock + raise the guide overlay) and a tap anywhere else toggles the
// NowPlayingBar — it never opens the channel list, which stays the tap target of
// the UNLOCKED flow (entered from the LIVE TV tile / zap). A mid-left "‹ Guide"
// pill, visible while the bar is, advertises the zone. BACK stays the round-4
// unlock → guide path.
// Search overlay (WS15, phone only): the NowPlayingBar's Search button raises the
// in-player channel search as another mode of this screen — portrait uses the
// guide's strip layout (video strip on top, SearchPanel below), landscape lays the
// panel over the fullscreen video on the translucent bed. It SURVIVES rotation in
// both directions (the query must not be lost; only the strip appears/disappears),
// the idle timers never touch it, and BACK (or a result tune — search has a
// destination, so tune CLOSES it, unlike the guide) returns to the orientation
// default: portrait 'guide', landscape 'none'. A playback error collapses it like
// the guide (the error text must stay visible). Result tunes go through play() —
// the same PIN-gated path as the channel list.
