// How many channels to pre-warm at login (lowest curated order first). Covers the
// typical zapping range; bounded so a big catalog doesn't open too many topics at once.
// ⚠ ZERO, NOT 12. Prewarm opened the first twelve channels' feeds the moment a device
// signed in, so EVERY logged-in app held a swarm connection to twelve channels it was
// not watching — twelve channels that could never sleep, and a peer count on the
// operator's dashboard that counted devices which were not watching anything. On an
// on-demand fleet the only channel worth holding is the one on screen; the cost of
// zero is a slightly colder first zap, and that is now covered by the wake, the 90 s
// tune budget and the on-screen "KANAL SE POKREĆE" animation.

// Adjacent-channel zap prefetch (keep the next/previous channels' newest segment
// replicated while watching, so CH+/CH- starts from warm bytes). This is only the
// COMPILED DEFAULT for first boot: the Settings "Smooth zapping" toggle persists the
// user's choice in the worklet prefs, which overrides this value on every boot and
// switches the engine live via backend.setZapPrefetch(). OFF by default — unlike
// prewarm it costs standing bandwidth ≈ the neighbors' bitrate while a channel
// plays (the engine's adaptive gate suspends it on metered networks, stalls, or a
// thin pipe — see sdk/player.js).
// How long the ENGINE may spend on one tune attempt before it evicts and retries. Default
// is 30 s; raised because a cold on-demand channel is started by the wake, and the first
// segment can take longer than that to appear. With the evict-and-retry ladder that gives
// ~2.5 minutes of honest trying before the engine calls the channel unreachable.

// "Send to TV": which half of it THIS device may play. The flags are not one switch —
// two of them are OPPOSITES on a television, on purpose — and reading them as one is the
// mistake this note exists to prevent.
//
//   sendToTv    the SENDING half. It makes every login keep the account's two private
//               keys in memory for the whole session, because a phone cannot recover them
//               later without the password (sdk/login.js `handover`). So it is asked for
//               only where it is used — a phone or a tablet, which is what a viewer picks
//               up to sign a television in. A television is never the sending device, so
//               a TV build holds nothing it could pass on.
//
//   keepSignIn  the RECEIVING half, and the only one about DISK. A set signed in by a
//               phone has no password to remember, so without this it comes back to the
//               sign-in screen every time Android reclaims the app process — which left a
//               handover-signed-in television WORSE off than a password-signed-in one and
//               defeated the feature. On, the material is kept, sealed under a key held
//               in the Android Keystore, and the set signs itself back in at the next
//               start (backend.resumeSignIn — see client/backend/backend.mjs).
//
//               TELEVISIONS ONLY, and not because a phone could not: a phone signed in by
//               another phone still has a keyboard and a password, so an account's keys at
//               rest on one more device buy nothing there. Every device holding key
//               material is a device an operator has to be able to reason about, so this
//               is on exactly where it is needed and nowhere else.
//
//   control     "Play on my TV" — the rendezvous the account's own devices meet on. ON
//               EVERYWHERE, because both ends of it are this app: a phone joins as the
//               controller that sends, a television joins as the one that announces and
//               takes commands, and a device that never joined is a device that cannot
//               be sent to. What it costs is a derived account secret held for the
//               session — not a key, but a live authenticator and a stable correlator
//               for "these devices are one account", which is why the engine keeps it
//               off until something asks. Nothing here is written down and no topic is
//               joined until startRemote() is called (client/src/sendToTv.ts calls it
//               after login, per role).
//
// Boot-time only, and there is no runtime switch on purpose: by the time one could be
// flipped the login has already happened, so the key material is either retained or
// unrecoverable. Settings hides "Sign in a TV" on the same test.
